# About Me
Hello! My name is Samantha Hardee, but everyone calls me Sam. I am 20 years old and a December baby. My pronouns are she/her and I am an IT Service & Support major. I have grown up around computers, due to my grandpa having technology experience. I have 4 pet Budgie birds and a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dog.

## My Interests
I really enjoy cosplay and video gaming. My favorite game right now is Genshin Impact. My favorite character from Genshin Impact is Hu Tao. I have been cosplaying for about 2-3 years and I attend a lot of conventions in cosplay. I really like Hello Kitty and Friends, also known as Sanrio. My favorite Sanrio character is Kuromi.

## Websites I Recommend

- [YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com) - YouTube is great for watching video tutorials on topics and videos of things that interest you.
